This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting protein subcellular localization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using classical, sequence-derived features. The goal is to provide a clear, interpretable baseline model that illustrates how early bioinformatics features can be used for multiclass classification, while allowing users to experiment with model choices, preprocessing strategies, and evaluation methods.

The dataset includes 1,484 yeast proteins, each described by 8 numerical features derived from protein sequence analysis and a categorical localization label with 10 possible classes (e.g., cytoplasmic, nuclear, mitochondrial).
